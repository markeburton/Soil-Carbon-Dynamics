R code for SNAP (Ritchie 2014) and SNPGRAZE (Ritchie 2020) soil carbon models with updated and additional calculations. 

The currently available code is described below, with additional models scheduled to be added. 

SNAPGRAZE v2.3
1. The original SNAPGRAZE model has been updated with new parameter coefficients and allows for calibration to fit a specific project area.
2. Additionally, we added a monte carlo simulation of the project scenario to better understand uncertainty to SOC predictions.
